# GeckoOS 1.9.3.1
Gecko OS is an application to allow the running of Import games and cheat codes.  This repo just updated the code a bit to allow the app to compile using the latest devkit tools.

Controls: Use Wii Remote D-Pad, Gamecube Pad or Classic Controller Pad. Region Free options can be set with the config menu before launching the game.

USB Gecko is only required if using WiiRD.
